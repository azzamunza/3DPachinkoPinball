Can you update the game play area shape boundary for https://github.com/azzamunza/3DPachinkoPinball/blob/main/src/index.html to conform to the layout shown in this example: https://github.com/azzamunza/3DPachinkoPinball/blob/main/references/Screenshot%202025-11-28%20155906.png

The example provided shows the location that I would like the Jackpot Machine to be placed.

I would like the Jackpot machine that I referenced above to be the Jackpot Machine I have prepared at https://github.com/azzamunza/3DPachinkoPinball/blob/main/JackpotMachine/index.html

I would like the Pachinko pins redesigned to conform closer to this example: https://github.com/azzamunza/3DPachinkoPinball/blob/main/references/hqdefault.jpg

I would like the game to include features and mechanics found on the following Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko#Design

Disable the right-click menu on the website. Make sure the left mouse click also triggers the left pinball trigger.

Include at the top of the game, two text fields to adjust the (x,y) offset for the mortar cannon, with a save button that will send the updated values to a config.json file in the GitHub repo using GitHub's native GitHub tokens to save the file to the repo.
