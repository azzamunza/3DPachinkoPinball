# Agent Instructions

## Purpose
This file will always be read by agents working on this repository. When processing updates, agents should save the submitted prompt to an appropriate directory.

## Instructions for Agents

When you receive a prompt for modifications to this repository:

1. **Save the prompt** as a markdown file in the `/Update_Prompts/` directory
2. Use the naming convention: `YY-MM-DD-HHMM-<brief-description>.md`
   - Example: `25-11-29-0631-ramp-and-cannon-changes.md`
3. Include the full prompt text in the saved file
4. Add a timestamp header to the saved file

## Current Prompt

**Date**: 2025-11-29T06:31:29.635Z

### Tasks Requested:

1. **Shorten ramps** - The ramps are way too long. They should only be there to create lift for the balls, which are then propelled through the air to the top.

2. **Background images** - There are no images created for the background play area.

3. **Remove power adjustment on mouse hold** - Holding the mouse should no longer adjust the power of the ball. It should only rapid-fire.

4. **Faster rapid fire** - The cannon's rapid fire needs to be 5 times faster.

5. **Save prompt file** - Add a file somewhere that will always be read by you, that will cause you to save the prompt submitted to this agent in an appropriate directory as a .md file.
